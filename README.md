# DodgerV2
A 2D spaceship shooter game in Unity.

DodgerV2 is a remake of "Dodger" a game I made in Unity around 2016 which you can find [here](https://github.com/thegrimsey/dodger). I made this remake for a project in my Tech class and to see how far I had come in the last years (as well as to figure out how far Unity had come).

The development log for this project is available on my website right [here](https://thegrimsey.net/games/DodgerV2.html).

# "Tech-stack"
DodgerV2 uses Unity's own ECS "Entities" in a hybrid model. Movement is handled in a system whilst collision between bullets, asteroids, and the player are handled in regular gameobjects.
